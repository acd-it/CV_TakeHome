### Approach to Web Application Design

1. **API Integration and Initial Testing**  
   I started by obtaining an API key and conducting tests in Postman to ensure that the API calls were functioning correctly and returning the expected results.

2. **Script Development and Logging**  
   I then developed a Python script, incorporating extensive logging for easier troubleshooting and analysis. The script was designed to retrieve secrets securely using the 1Password CLI, ensuring that all functions were working as intended.

3. **Conversion to Web Application using Flask**  
   Recognizing the need for a web interface, I utilized Flask to convert the Python script into a web application. Given my relative inexperience with HTML, I leveraged ChatGPT to assist with the front-end design to ensure the UI was both functional and user-friendly.

4. **Error Handling and Input Validation**  
   Once the core functionality of the app was operational, I focused on enhancing the user experience by implementing error handling and input validation. This helped ensure that the app would gracefully handle invalid inputs or errors.

5. **Quality Assurance and Bug Fixing**  
   I performed extensive quality testing to identify and resolve any bugs or issues. Each identified bug was treated as an opportunity for iteration, leading to further refinement of the appâ€™s functionality.

6. **User Experience Enhancements**  
   The application was updated to provide clear error messages if an invalid or non-existent city was entered, as well as placeholder text and an input help guide to assist users.

7. **Future Improvements**  
   If given more time, I would explore adding an account or login system to allow users to save their search history. Additionally, I would consider incorporating icons related to the comfort index to further enhance the visual appeal and functionality of the app.
